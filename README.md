Started one year ago, this project served as a reference for people to use when constructing an RTS project in Unity 3D. I have not posted anything to this project in about 7-8 months and I feel now it is time to bring it back. I have learned a lot from my programming courses and continue to learn more. Because of my new knowledge of programming, I am starting this project from the beginning again. I am not completetly trashing everything but I am creating a new structure that will make it simpler to understand and easier to customize. I started to become too messy with some of my code as I went on before and I am trying to learn from those mistakes. This time I want to make something that makes me proud to present it to my Youtube community so that they can learn as well.
